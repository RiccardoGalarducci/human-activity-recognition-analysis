# Human Activity Recognition Analysis
This repository contains the **Advanced Data Mining project** of my Master's degree in Data Science & Business Informatics at University of Pisa.
The aim of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of different machine learning methods and techinques on 
[Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).


## Description

The tasks afforded in the project are:

- Classification with basic techniques
- Outlier detection
- Dimensionality reduction
- Regression
- Time series analysis
- Time series classification
- Advanced clustering
- Advanced classification
- Sequential Pattern Mining

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf report of the project and the **\code** folder which contains the jupyter notebooks diveded for tasks afforded.
